Hello, world! This is my first blog post on my newly set up website. I doubt that I will post *too* often, but you never know. I think I the posts will be mainly about things that I have figured out and it will be a way of backing up the solution so I don't forget how I've done something.

I am planning to update this website in the future, however I might switch to another theme. The one I am currently using is great as it was exactly what I was looking for: minimalistic, fast, good-looking. Initially, it was a single-page theme (they seem to be popular at the moment), but I didn't like that so I modified it and split the content into separate pages. There were a few other small things I didn't like too and while I was at it, I made a lot of modifications and ended spending probably about a week customising the theme. I am still unhappy with some small details, but I could probably edit it forever if I didn't stop at some point. 

Unfortunately, I don't think this theme is being actively updated and it is missing some features that most themes provide but I managed to implement them myself. I also added a completely custom-made projects page which pulls data directly from GitHub and shows my most-used programming languages and my "best" projects (my pinned repositories on GitHub) including their descriptions and the languages used to create them. The data is not dynamically updated since Hugo allows the creation of *static* websites. Instead, it is updated every time I deploy an update to the website. This is a limitation and I might switch to another method in the future.

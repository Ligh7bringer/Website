Hi! I am Svet and I recently graduated from Edinburgh Napier University. I did a 4-year course in Software Engineering. Welcome to my website/blog (although I rarely add blog posts). 

My programming-related interestes include but are not limited to: games development & computer graphics (OpenGL), Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, web development (not too much), CPU & GPU concurrency (multithreading, OpenCL, SYCL, CUDA), Linux.

I currently work at [Codeplay Software](https://www.codeplay.com/) on high performance GPU programming (SYCL and some other stuff).

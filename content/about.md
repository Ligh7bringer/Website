Hi! My name is Svetlozar Georgiev and I recently graduated from Edinburgh Napier University. I did a 4-year course in Software Engineering. I am currently looking for a job which is why I created a portfolio website.

My programming-related interestes include but are not limited to: games development & computer graphics (OpenGL), Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, web development, CPU & GPU concurrency (multithreading, OpenCL, CUDA), Linux.

Other than programming, I enjoy socialising and meeting new people, cooking, listening to music and going to gigs, watching films (but mostly series).
